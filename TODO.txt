Formatting rules:
	Margins		Size specified		Align		New Size Behavior
		0				na			Stretch		Fill to max
		0				na			*			Fill to children, limited by max and position accordingly
		0				y			Stretch		Error - cannot specify both Size and Align==Stretch
		0				y			*			Fill to Size, limited by max and position accordingly
		1				na			Stretch		Fill to max - margin, position by margin
		1				na			*			Fill to children, limited by max - margin and position accordingly
		1				y			Stretch		Error - cannot specify both Size and Align==Stretch
		1				y			*			Fill to Size, limited by max - margin, positioned as if size = size + margin
		2				na			Stretch		Fill to max - margin, position by margin
		2				na			*			Fill to children, limited by max - margin and position accordingly
		2				y			Stretch		Error - cannot specify both Size and Align==Stretch

	Align is specified as one or two values.  E.g.:   Left |  Left,Stretch | ,Center			
	Size is specified as one or two values:  x,y			
	With no parent, max is screen size			
	With scroll viewer, max is arbitrary, but there must be a clipping stage when rendering			
	Labels adjust their size to the text in them.  If they wrap, they wrap to the max size width
