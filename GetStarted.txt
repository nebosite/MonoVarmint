MonoVarmint is a helpful framework for working with MonoGame.  
It is:
	- open-source (MIT License)
	- Provided as a shared-code project (not dll) to simplify distribution

To get started:

	- Download the MonoVarmint code from github
	- Create a MonoGame project for one of the supported platforms: Windows, Android, ios, etc...
	- Create a Monogame shared code project
	- Unload your monogame project and edit the csproj file
	- Add shared project references to your monogame project:
		- Open the csproj file in a text editor
		- Add these lines near the other imports (you will have to corret the relative paths and project names)
			<Import Project="..\..\MonoVarmint\Tools\VarmintTools.projitems" Label="Shared" />
			<Import Project="..\..\MonoVarmint\Widgets\VarmintWidgets.projitems" Label="Shared" />
			<Import Project="..\[Replace with SharedMonoGameProject]" Label="Shared" />
	- Reload your monogame project
	- Delete the Game1 class in the shared code project and replace with the one in MonoVarmint/Demo.Shared/GameRunner.cs
		- Fix the namespace to match your own
	- Delete the Game1 class in the Monogame project and add a new class:  [Platform]GameRunner  
		- E.g.   WindowsGameRunner or AndroidGameRunner, etc.
		- Make sure to fix the references to Game1 to be [Platform]GameRunner
	- Add vwml files as embeded resources (VarmintWidget.LoadLayout will find these automatically)
